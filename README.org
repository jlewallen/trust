* Introduction

  This is a sandbox for me to play with some ideas that have been swirling around.

* Debugging

  1) watch nvidia-smi

* Developer Notes

** Issues with numpy and tensorflow versions. Usually visible because of
   a ton of warnings when importing the python module.

** CUDA

   https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn

   Version 7 only, the 8 RC was broken for me. Errors when compiling test program during cmake of dlib.

   I had to kill X11 and run the installer.

   1) Ctrl-Alt-F1
   2) sudo service lightdm stop
   3) sudo init 3
   5) sudo ./cuda-???
   6) sudo reboot
